- 👋 Hi, I’m @HandyDudes A.K.A Bill
- 👀 I create art, write code, fix houses and whoop a mean bar-b-que~!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to develop smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
-   The toolchain is a bit daunting, but I'm getting there.  I suppose I am also
-   learning to write React apps as a result.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not much just now. I'm still getting a feel for the environment.
- 📫 You can find me on Twitter at @BillMurHDGLI,
